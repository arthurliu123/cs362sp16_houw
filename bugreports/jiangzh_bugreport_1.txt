One detected bug in card  "Village_function" :
		Both my unit tester and random tester for card effect village show that the numActions is not correct
	after the village card is played. Results tells that the numActions is one more than the correct result. I
	checked your village_function and found that  
									your statement is  "state->numActions = state->numActions + 3;"
									correct statement is "state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;"
