Unit Tests:
	all tested functions works well
	
Card Tests: 
	One bug in the cardEffect() function
		When a card effect requires the player to discard another cards in his/her hand, the function will replace discarded card with 
		the card in the index. If the played card is in the last index, it will be moved to another index. The discard function for the 
		played card will not work because the played card's index passed to cardEffect() is a bad index. As a result, the played card will
		not be moved to the playedCard.
		
Conclusion:
	My unit tests worked well as the rule expected. Unit tests for choose functions did not find any bug, but unit tests for the card effect 
	functions find a logic bug. This bug does not come from midunderstanding of game rules, but from the lack of index track for hand cards. 
    To fix that, the game shoud keep tracking card rather than the card index. 
    	The gcov command shows that "Lines executed:16.40% of 561". 
	The 'dominion.c.gcov' file:
		1. The KindomCards and the initializeGame function is executed but need more tests. 
			My aim functions are not this two functions, but these two functions are necessary
			parts.
		2. Some API functions I used are not tested.
