Debugging Report with GDB:
	I. First Bug (Adventuruer Card section in CardEffect() )
		a. Found a bug in CardEffect function adventurer section:
			When I wrote random test of the adventurer card, I only checked the card effect that allows the player to 
		reveal two trueature cards from the player deck. To test that, I checked playe's hand count and player's hand 
		card. The test results showed that the player did not get right hand count.
		
		b. Debugging Procedures
			Before debugged the dominion.c, I first thought about where the bug come from. I came up with two assumptions:
			Gmae Initialization Error and Card Effect Error.
			
			1. Debug Game Initialization
				Since only the player's hand count showed error, I set up two break points before the CardEffect fucntion.
			One is after the function initializeGame() in line 42 of randomtestadventurer.c; another one is after I randomly 
			generate the player's hand count in line 45 of randomtestadventurer.c. I called numHandCards(), which returned 
			the right results
			
			2. Debug Card Effect
				Then, I started to debug the CardEffect. I set up break point in line 774 of dominion.c to check whether the 
			player can get right number of treature cards. I found that there was no error here. Then, I set another break point
			in line 778 to check wheter the program reomve non-treature cards from the player's hand. There was also on error here.
			
				At that time, I thought it was a system error. So, I ran my random tests for thousands of time. However, wrong hand
			count returned every time. I decided to test more specifically. I reset all those break points and checked the hand count
			and hand card. I noticed that the card adventurer was still in the player's hand after the player got two treature cards. 
			This fact occured all the time. I reviewed the dominion.c and found that the CardEffect() did not discard the adventurer
			card from the player's hand. I added the discard function and the random test passed for thousands of time. 
		
		c. Related Agan's Rules
				Rule#2 "Make it Fail"
					I only focus on the CardEffect but ignore other details. I should consider all possible failure factors,
				
				Rule#5 "Change One Thing at a Time"
					I break possible failure cases into different parts to debug (initializeGame () and cardeffect()). This 
				fact reduces the debug time and make debugging easier more specfic.

				Rule#8 "Get a Fresh View"
					I did not give up when I cannot localize the bug. I changed my debugging view (from hand count to actul hand
				cards). This trick helped me to find the bug.

				
				
	II. Second Bug (_cardEffect_greate hall() Function)
		a. Found bug by jiangzh
			This bug was found by one of my group member, Zhi Jiang. According to his bug report, the player's hand count was wrong
		after played the card great hall.
		
		b. Debugging Procedures
			I choose the same debugging strategies that I used in debugging the adventurer card. 
			
			1. Debugging Game Initialization
				Same procedures in section I.b.1. I found no bug here.
				
			2. Debugging Card Effect 
				In this debugging session, I set two break points
